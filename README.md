# Blue-Shirts

- The dataset contains an unlabelled set of images and a smaller dataset that contains labelled images.
- Those images represent shirts from an e-commerce, so usually the background is plain and the product is the focus of the image.
- The unlabelled dataset provided contains 5K samples and the labelled one contains just 10 images, all of _blue_ shirts. 
- __Goal__: Build a model that is able to retrieve all the blue shirts from the 5K dataset.
